# plotlet cookbook

Worked examples of **multi-component, domain-specific plots** — annotated
heatmap layouts, genome browser tracks, and similar substantial recipes
that compose custom artists with [plotlet](https://github.com/gitbamboo42/plotlet)'s
layout algebra.

Requirements: `pip install plotlet`. (These recipes use only core plotlet —
no separate install needed.)

The cookbook is intentionally small. Each recipe earns its directory by
needing ancillary material (sample data, baselines, helper logic) and
demonstrating non-obvious composition, custom artists, or coordinate
patterns (e.g. [`circle/`](circle/) shows non-affine coordinates via
post-render SVG warping). Each recipe is self-contained — browse the
subdirectories directly; there is no central index.

## How to use a recipe

1. Copy the recipe folder into your project.
2. Register any custom artists with `pt.add_artist(pt.ArtistSpec(...))`
   — see [`docs/EXTENDING.md`](https://github.com/gitbamboo42/plotlet/blob/main/docs/EXTENDING.md)
   for the full API.
3. Adjust styling, data shape, and details for your use case.
